# Security Policy

## Overview

Security is a fundamental principle across all our projects, regardless of technology stack, deployment target, or project purpose. This document outlines our comprehensive security approach covering development practices, infrastructure management, and incident response procedures.

## Supported Versions

We maintain security support for project versions according to the following general guidelines:

| Version Type   | Supported | Support Duration               |
| -------------- | --------- | ------------------------------ |
| Latest Major   | ✅        | Full security support          |
| Previous Major | ✅        | Critical security fixes only   |
| Older Versions | ❌        | End of life - upgrade required |

**Note**: Specific version support may vary by project. Check individual project documentation for detailed version support policies.

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth

We implement multiple layers of security controls:

- **Application Layer**: Input validation, output encoding, authentication, authorization
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Network segmentation, access controls, encryption
- **Operational Layer**: Monitoring, logging, incident response, regular security assessments
- **Process Layer**: Secure development lifecycle, code review, security training

### Principle of Least Privilege

- Grant minimum necessary permissions for users, services, and systems
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) where applicable
- Regularly review and audit access permissions
- Use temporary credentials and just-in-time access when possible

### Security by Design

- Consider security implications during architecture and design phases
- Implement security controls early in the development lifecycle
- Use secure defaults in all configurations
- Design systems to fail securely

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

## Development Security Standards

### Secure Coding Practices

#### Input Validation and Sanitization

```javascript
// Example: Input validation
function validateUserInput(input) {
  // Validate format, length, and content
  if (!input || typeof input !== 'string') {
    throw new ValidationError('Invalid input format')
  }

  // Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks
  return sanitizeHtml(input.trim())
}
```

#### Authentication and Authorization

- Implement strong authentication mechanisms (MFA where possible)
- Use established authentication libraries and frameworks
- Never store passwords in plain text
- Implement proper session management
- Use JWT tokens with appropriate expiration times
- Validate all user permissions for each operation

#### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt all sensitive data in storage
- **Encryption in Transit**: Use TLS 1.2+ for all data transmission
- **Key Management**: Use dedicated key management services
- **Data Classification**: Classify data based on sensitivity levels
- **Data Retention**: Implement appropriate data retention and deletion policies

### Secret Management

#### What Constitutes a Secret

- API keys and tokens
- Database credentials
- Encryption keys
- Private certificates
- OAuth client secrets
- Service account credentials

#### Secret Handling Best Practices

```yaml
# ❌ Never do this - secrets in code
database:
  password: "hardcoded-password-123"

# ✅ Use environment variables or secret management
database:
  password: ${DATABASE_PASSWORD}
```

#### Approved Secret Management Solutions

- **Cloud Native**: AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager
- **Multi-Cloud**: HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes Secrets
- **Development**: Docker secrets, encrypted environment files
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Secrets, GitLab CI/CD Variables, Azure DevOps Variable Groups

### Code Security Reviews

All code changes must undergo security review focusing on:

- **Input Validation**: Proper sanitization and validation
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Correct implementation of access controls
- **Data Handling**: Proper encryption and data protection
- **Dependency Security**: No known vulnerable dependencies
- **Error Handling**: No information leakage in error messages
- **Logging**: Appropriate security event logging without exposing sensitive data

### Infrastructure as Code Security

#### Security Scanning

All infrastructure code must pass security scanning:

```bash
# Example security scanning pipeline
- name: "Infrastructure Security Scan"
  run: |
    # Static analysis
    checkov -d . --framework terraform
    tfsec .
