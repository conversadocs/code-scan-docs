# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## What are Architecture Decision Records?

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are short text documents that capture important architectural decisions made during the development of a project. They help teams understand the context, rationale, and consequences of decisions, making it easier for future team members to understand why certain choices were made.

## Why Use ADRs?

- **Preserve Context**: Capture the reasoning behind decisions that might not be obvious from code alone
- **Enable Learning**: Help team members understand past decisions and their outcomes
- **Facilitate Onboarding**: Provide new team members with historical context
- **Support Evolution**: Document when and why decisions change over time
- **Improve Communication**: Create a shared understanding of architectural choices
- **Reduce Repetition**: Avoid revisiting the same discussions repeatedly

## When to Write an ADR

Create an ADR when making decisions that:

- Have long-term impact on the system architecture
- Are difficult or expensive to reverse
- Affect multiple teams or components
- Involve trade-offs between competing alternatives
- Establish patterns or conventions for the project
- Solve complex technical problems
- Impact security, performance, or scalability

## ADR Naming Convention

ADRs should be named using the following format:

```
XXXX-title-of-decision.md
```

Where:

- **XXXX**: Four-digit sequential number (0001, 0002, 0003, etc.)
- **title-of-decision**: Descriptive title using kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)

### Examples:

```
0001-use-typescript-for-frontend.md
0002-adopt-microservices-architecture.md
0003-implement-event-driven-messaging.md
0004-choose-postgresql-as-primary-database.md
0005-establish-api-versioning-strategy.md
```

## ADR Template

Use the following template for all ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title of Decision]

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYYY]

## Context

[Describe the issue or problem that motivates this decision. Include the forces at play: technical, political, social, and project-local. This section should be value-neutral.]

## Decision

[State the architecture decision and provide rationale. This section should clearly state what we decided to do.]

## Consequences

### Positive

- [List the positive consequences of this decision]

### Negative

- [List the negative consequences or trade-offs]

### Neutral

- [List any neutral consequences or notes]

## Implementation

[Optional: Describe how this decision will be implemented, including any migration steps if changing from a previous approach]

## Alternatives Considered

[List the alternatives that were considered and why they were rejected]

## References

[Optional: Include links to relevant documentation, discussions, or external resources]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Author(s)**: [Name(s) of decision makers]
**Reviewers**: [Names of people who reviewed this ADR]
```

## ADR Lifecycle

### 1. Proposed

- ADR is drafted and shared for review
- Team discusses the proposal
- Feedback is incorporated

### 2. Accepted

- Team agrees on the decision
- ADR is merged into the repository
- Implementation begins

### 3. Deprecated

- Decision is no longer recommended
- Usually when superseded by a new ADR
- Original ADR remains for historical context

### 4. Superseded

- Decision has been replaced by a newer decision
- Reference the superseding ADR number
- Original ADR remains for historical context

## Best Practices

### Writing Guidelines

1. **Keep it Concise**: ADRs should be readable in 5-10 minutes
2. **Be Specific**: Include concrete details rather than vague statements
3. **Stay Objective**: Present facts and reasoning, not opinions
4. **Include Trade-offs**: Acknowledge the negative consequences honestly
5. **Use Simple Language**: Write for future team members who may not have context

### Process Guidelines

1. **One Decision per ADR**: Don't combine multiple decisions in a single document
2. **Immutable History**: Never delete or substantially modify accepted ADRs
3. **Regular Reviews**: Periodically review ADRs to see if decisions need updating
4. **Team Involvement**: Include relevant stakeholders in the decision process
5. **Link Related ADRs**: Reference other ADRs when decisions are related

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Too Late**: Writing ADRs after implementation is complete
- **Too Vague**: Decisions that could apply to any project
- **Too Technical**: Focusing only on implementation details
- **Missing Alternatives**: Not considering or documenting other options
- **No Follow-up**: Not updating ADRs when circumstances change

## Example ADR Structure

Here's a brief example of how an ADR might look:

```markdown
# ADR-0001: Use TypeScript for Frontend Development

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our team needs to choose a language for frontend development. We're building a complex web application with multiple developers who have varying levels of JavaScript experience. We need to balance development speed, maintainability, and type safety.

## Decision

We will use TypeScript for all frontend development, including React components, utility functions, and build scripts.

## Consequences

### Positive

- Improved code quality through static typing
- Better IDE support and developer experience
- Easier refactoring and maintenance
- Reduced runtime errors

### Negative

- Additional build step complexity
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with TypeScript
- Potential slower initial development

### Neutral

- Need to maintain type definitions
- Requires configuration of build tools

## Alternatives Considered

- **Plain JavaScript**: Rejected due to lack of type safety
- **Flow**: Rejected due to declining community support
- **ReasonML**: Rejected due to steep learning curve

## Managing ADRs in Your Project

### Repository Organization

Store ADRs in your project repository:

```
docs/
├── adrs/
│   ├── README.md (this file)
│   ├── 0001-use-typescript-for-frontend.md
│   ├── 0002-adopt-microservices-architecture.md
│   ├── 0003-implement-event-driven-messaging.md
│   └── template.md
└── ...
```

### Tooling

Consider using tools to help manage ADRs:

- **[adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools)**: Command-line tools for creating and managing ADRs
- **[adr-log](https://adr.github.io/adr-log/)**: Generate a summary of all ADRs
- **[Structurizr](https://structurizr.com/)**: Include ADRs in architectural documentation

### Integration with Development Process

- Include ADR creation in your definition of done for architectural decisions
- Reference ADRs in code comments when implementing architectural patterns
- Review ADRs during architectural reviews and retrospectives
- Update your project's main documentation to reference relevant ADRs

## ADR Index

As you create ADRs, maintain an index here for easy navigation:

| ADR                              | Title            | Status   | Date       |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------- | ---------- |
| [0001](0001-example-decision.md) | Example Decision | Proposed | 2024-01-15 |

<!--
When you create new ADRs, add them to the table above in chronological order.
Keep this table updated as ADR statuses change.
