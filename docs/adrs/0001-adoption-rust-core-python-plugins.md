# ADR-0001: Adoption of Rust for Core, Python for Plugins, and CLI-First Design

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The `code-scan-docs` project aims to analyze codebases using AI to generate documentation, perform code reviews, and identify security concerns. We need a robust and efficient core to handle intensive file system operations, matrix management, and orchestration with Large Language Models (LLMs). Additionally, we require extensibility to support multiple programming languages and the ability to integrate language-specific analyses.

Key considerations include:

- **Performance**: Handling large codebases efficiently.
- **Extensibility**: Supporting various programming languages through plugins.
- **Developer Accessibility**: Providing an interface that developers can easily use and integrate into their workflows.
- **Community Contribution**: Encouraging contributions from the open-source community.

## Decision

We have decided to:

- Utilize **Rust** for building the core functionalities of the application.
- Implement **Python** plugins for language-specific analyses.
- Design the application as **CLI-first**, emphasizing a command-line interface for user interaction.

### Rationale

- **Rust Core**:
  - Offers high performance and efficient memory management, crucial for processing large codebases.
  - Provides strong concurrency support for parallel file reading and processing.
  - Ensures memory safety, reducing bugs and security vulnerabilities.
- **Python Plugins**:
  - Widely used and known for ease of writing and readability, lowering the barrier for community contributions.
  - Extensive libraries and frameworks support rapid development of analysis tools.
  - Facilitates integration with numerous programming languages due to existing parsing and analysis libraries.
- **CLI-First Design**:
  - Aligns with developer preferences for tools that can be integrated into scripts and CI/CD pipelines.
  - Simplifies deployment and usage without the overhead of a graphical interface.
  - Enhances automation capabilities, allowing the tool to be used in various development workflows.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **High Performance**: Rust ensures fast execution times and efficient resource utilization.
- **Safety**: Rust's compiler checks prevent many common bugs and security issues.
- **Extensibility**: Python plugins make it easy to add support for new languages and analyses.
- **Ease of Use**: A CLI tool is straightforward for developers to adopt and integrate.
- **Community Engagement**: Python's popularity may lead to increased community contributions.
- **Automation Friendly**: CLI tools are easily incorporated into automated processes.

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Developers may need to learn Rust, which can be more complex than other languages.
- **Complexity in Integration**: Inter-process communication between Rust and Python adds complexity.
- **Dependency Management**: Requires handling dependencies for both Rust and Python environments.
- **Potential Performance Bottlenecks**: Python plugins may introduce performance issues compared to a pure Rust implementation.

### Neutral

- **Multiple Technology Stacks**: While offering benefits, using both Rust and Python requires familiarity with two ecosystems.
- **Cross-Platform Considerations**: Need to ensure compatibility across different operating systems for both Rust and Python components.

## Implementation

- **Core Development in Rust**:
  - Use Rust for all core functionalities, including file system operations, data management, and LLM orchestration.
  - Leverage Rust's asynchronous capabilities for handling I/O-bound tasks efficiently.
- **Plugin System in Python**:
  - Define a plugin interface using JSON over stdin/stdout or named pipes for communication.
  - Manage Python subprocesses from the Rust core, ensuring isolation and error handling.
  - Provide documentation and examples to assist developers in creating plugins.
- **CLI Development**:
  - Utilize Rust crates like `clap` for command-line argument parsing and interface design.
  - Implement features for configuration management, progress reporting, and output formatting.
  - Focus on a user-friendly experience with clear help messages and documentation.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Using Rust Exclusively**:
  - Considered writing both the core and plugins in Rust for performance consistency.
  - Rejected due to the steeper learning curve and potential to limit community contributions.
- **Using Python Exclusively**:
  - Considered using Python for both core and plugins for simplicity.
  - Rejected due to potential performance issues with large-scale file operations.
- **Developing a GUI Application**:
  - Considered a graphical user interface for ease of use.
  - Rejected in favor of CLI for better automation and integration into developer workflows.
- **Using Other Languages (e.g., Go, Node.js)**:
  - Evaluated other languages like Go for the core.
  - Rejected in favor of Rust's superior performance and safety features.
