# Project Overview

## What This Project Does

`code-scan-docs` is an open-source tool that leverages AI to scan codebases and generate comprehensive artifacts. It automates the process of analyzing each file in a codebase, determining its role and relationships within the project, and creating a matrix of information. This includes file summaries, function summaries, dependency mappings, and usage relationships. The tool performs code reviews to identify bad code practices and security concerns and can also generate or populate documentation templates, streamlining the documentation process.

## Why This Project Exists

### Business Context

Modern software projects often involve large and complex codebases, making it challenging for developers to maintain up-to-date documentation, perform thorough code reviews, and ensure code quality. Manual documentation is time-consuming and prone to errors, while overlooked code issues can lead to security vulnerabilities and maintenance burdens. `code-scan-docs` addresses these challenges by automating code analysis and documentation, improving developer productivity and codebase reliability.

### Technical Drivers

- **Complexity Management**: As codebases grow, understanding and maintaining them becomes difficult. Automated analysis helps manage this complexity.
- **Efficiency**: Automating documentation and code reviews reduces manual effort and accelerates development cycles.
- **Quality Assurance**: Identifying bad code and security concerns early helps maintain high code quality.
- **Extensibility**: A plugin architecture allows for language-specific analyses and easy integration of new features.
- **Performance**: Using Rust for the core ensures high performance for file system operations and data processing.

### Success Criteria

- **Accurate Analysis**: Correctly identifies files, their types, and relationships within the codebase.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Generates useful summaries and documentation that aid developers.
- **Issue Detection**: Effectively identifies code issues and security vulnerabilities.
- **Extensibility**: Supports additional languages and functionalities through plugins.
- **User Adoption**: Positive feedback and adoption by the developer community.

## Project Scope

### What This Project Does

- **File System Operations**: Scans directories recursively, detects file types, filters files, and reads them in parallel.
- **Matrix Management**: Creates and manages a data structure (matrix/graph) representing code relationships.
- **LLM Orchestration**: Integrates with Large Language Models via APIs to analyze code and generate summaries.
- **Plugin System**: Utilizes Python plugins for language-specific analyses, managed through inter-process communication.
- **CLI Interface**: Provides a command-line interface for configuration, progress reporting, and output formatting.

### What This Project Does NOT Do (Non-Goals)

- **Code Compilation**: Does not compile or execute code from the codebase.
- **Interactive IDE Integration**: Is not a plugin for IDEs or code editors.
- **Language Linting**: Does not perform syntax checking or linting specific to programming languages.
- **Deployment Automation**: Does not handle deployment or CI/CD pipeline configurations.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Does not monitor codebases for changes in real-time beyond watch mode functionality.

### Boundaries and Integration Points

- **Git Integration**: Interacts with Git for ignoring files and analyzing diffs.
- **LLM APIs**: Connects to external APIs like OpenAI, Ollama, or Anthropic for AI capabilities.
- **Plugins**: Communicates with Python plugins to extend functionality.
- **User Environment**: Operates within the user's local environment and respects system permissions.

- **Feature Branches**: `feature/your-feature` (new features and enhancements)
- **Hotfix Branches**: `hotfix/your-hotfix` (critical fixes)

### Code Review Process

- Submit a pull request to the `main` branch.
- Ensure your code adheres to the coding standards.
- All pull requests require at least one code review approval.
- Automated checks must pass before merging.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: For individual components and functions.
- **Integration Tests**: To test interactions between the core and plugins.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate real-world usage scenarios.
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated tests run on each pull request.

### Deployment Process

As a CLI tool, deployment involves:

- Building the application using Cargo for Rust components.
- Publishing releases on GitHub with precompiled binaries.
- Users can install via Cargo or download binaries directly.

## Integration Information

### APIs and Interfaces

- **LLM APIs**: Communicates with LLM services like OpenAI or local models via RESTful APIs.
- **Plugin Interface**: Uses inter-process communication (JSON over stdin/stdout) with Python plugins.
- **Git Integration**: Interacts with Git repositories for file ignoring and diff analysis.

### Data Flow

1. **Scanning**: The core scans the codebase and identifies files.
2. **Matrix Generation**: Builds a data structure representing code relationships.
3. **Analysis**: LLMs and plugins analyze code and augment the matrix.
4. **Output**: Generates reports, documentation, and alerts based on the analysis.

### Dependencies

- **Rust**: For core functionalities.
- **Python**: For plugins.
- **LLM Services**: External APIs for AI capabilities.
- **Git**: For repository interactions.

### Monitoring and Health Checks

- **Logging**: Verbose logging options for debugging.
- **Error Handling**: Captures and reports errors without terminating the entire process.
- **Progress Reporting**: CLI displays progress and status updates.

## Performance Characteristics

### Expected Load

- Designed to handle small to large codebases efficiently.
- Performance depends on codebase size and complexity.

### Scaling Behavior

- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes multi-threading for file reading and analysis.
- **Resource Management**: Configurable settings to manage CPU and memory usage.

### Resource Requirements

- **CPU**: Increased usage during scanning and analysis.
- **Memory**: Depends on codebase size; large projects require more memory.
- **API Limits**: Depends on codebase size; large projects require higher usage limits for LLMs.

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization

- **API Keys**: Securely manage API keys for LLM services; users provide their keys.
- **Access Control**: Runs with user-level permissions; does not require elevated privileges.

### Data Protection

- **Code Privacy**: Be cautious when sending code to external LLM APIs; ensure compliance with privacy policies.
- **Temporary Data**: Avoid storing sensitive data; temporary files are managed securely.

### Network Security

- **Secure Connections**: Uses HTTPS for all external API communications.
- **Firewall Settings**: Ensure that the network allows necessary outbound connections.

### Compliance Requirements

- Users are responsible for complying with licenses and regulations when analyzing code, especially proprietary codebases.

## Disaster Recovery

### Backup Strategy

- Since the tool is read-only with respect to the codebase, it does not modify code or configuration files.
- Users should maintain regular backups of their codebases independently.

### Recovery Procedures

- **Error Recovery**: Restart the tool; it can resume analysis as needed.
- **Data Corruption**: In case of data issues within generated artifacts, regenerate the outputs.

### Business Continuity

- The tool can be integrated into existing workflows without affecting system availability.
