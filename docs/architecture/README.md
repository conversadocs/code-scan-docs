# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

[Provide a brief, high-level description of the system architecture. What type of system is this? What architectural patterns does it follow?]

Example:

> This is a microservices-based e-commerce platform built using event-driven architecture. The system consists of domain-bounded services that communicate through asynchronous messaging and synchronous APIs.

## Architecture Principles

[List the key architectural principles that guide design decisions in this project]

- **[Principle 1]**: [Brief explanation]
- **[Principle 2]**: [Brief explanation]
- **[Principle 3]**: [Brief explanation]

## Key Components

[List the major components/services and their primary responsibilities]

| Component            | Purpose        | Technology   |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| **[Component Name]** | [What it does] | [Tech stack] |
| **[Component Name]** | [What it does] | [Tech stack] |
| **[Component Name]** | [What it does] | [Tech stack] |

## Data Flow

[Brief description of how data moves through the system - save detailed diagrams for Structurizr]

## Integration Patterns

[Describe the main integration patterns used]

- **[Pattern Type]**: [When and how it's used]
- **[Pattern Type]**: [When and how it's used]

Key architectural decisions are documented in [Architecture Decision Records](../adrs/README.md):

[List the most important ADRs that shaped the current architecture]

- [ADR-XXXX: Major Architectural Decision](../adrs/XXXX-major-decision.md)
- [ADR-YYYY: Important Technology Choice](../adrs/YYYY-technology-choice.md)

## Quality Attributes

[Define the key quality attributes and how the architecture addresses them]

| Quality Attribute | Target            | Architectural Approach           |
| ----------------- | ----------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Performance**   | [Target metric]   | [How architecture achieves this] |
| **Scalability**   | [Target metric]   | [How architecture achieves this] |
| **Availability**  | [Target metric]   | [How architecture achieves this] |
| **Security**      | [Target standard] | [How architecture achieves this] |

## Deployment Architecture

[High-level deployment approach - detailed diagrams in Structurizr]

- **Environment Strategy**: [How environments are structured]
- **Infrastructure Pattern**: [Cloud/on-prem/hybrid approach]
- **Deployment Model**: [How services are deployed and managed]

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

[List the primary technologies used across the system]

- **Languages**: [Primary programming languages]
- **Frameworks**: [Key frameworks and libraries]
- **Databases**: [Data storage technologies]
- **Infrastructure**: [Cloud platform, container orchestration, etc.]

### Supporting Technologies

- **Security**: [Security tools and frameworks]
- **DevOps**: [CI/CD and deployment tools]

## Development Guidelines

### Architecture Compliance

[How to ensure new development follows architectural guidelines]

- Review [development standards](../standards/README.md)
- Follow established [integration patterns](#integration-patterns)
- Consult [ADRs](../adrs/README.md) for decision context
- Validate changes against [quality attributes](#quality-attributes)

### When to Update Architecture

[Guidelines for when architectural documentation needs updates]

- Adding new services or components
- Changing integration patterns
- Modifying data flow
- Infrastructure changes
- Performance or security requirement changes
