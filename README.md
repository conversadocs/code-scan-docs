# code-scan-docs

`code-scan-docs` is an open-source tool that leverages AI to analyze your codebase, generating comprehensive documentation and conducting automated code reviews. By scanning your project's files and mapping their relationships, it provides valuable insights into dependencies and potential code issues, streamlining development and documentation workflows.

## Overview

`code-scan-docs` simplifies the process of understanding and documenting large codebases through intelligent automation. Built with a high-performance Rust core and extensible Python plugins, it recursively scans your project directories to identify each file, determine its role within the project, and map out relationships between files and functions. This process generates a detailed matrix of information, including summaries, dependency graphs, and usage relationships.

Armed with this in-depth analysis, `code-scan-docs` can perform automated code reviews, identifying bad coding practices and potential security vulnerabilities. It also facilitates the creation of comprehensive documentation by generating content or populating existing templates, ensuring that your documentation stays up-to-date with minimal manual effort. Whether you're aiming to improve code quality, enhance security, or streamline documentation, `code-scan-docs` integrates seamlessly into your development workflow to support these goals.
