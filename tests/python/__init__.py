"""
Python tests for CSD plugins.

This package contains tests for the CSD plugin system, including:
- Base analyzer functionality tests
- Individual plugin tests (python_analyzer, rust_analyzer, etc.)
- Plugin communication protocol tests

These tests serve as both verification for the built-in plugins
and as examples for external plugin developers.
